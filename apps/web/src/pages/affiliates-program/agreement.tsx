        </Text>

        <Text as="h3">4. Determination and Calculation of Commissions</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.1 We will provide you with a unique referral link which will allow our system to track your Referrals and
          their trading activities. We will only pay commissions for Referrals who have signed up through your unique
          referral link. We will not pay commissions if someone says they signed up through you but such a sign up was
          not done through the referral link.
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">4.2 All commissions will be paid out in CAKE tokens.</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.3 All commissions are calculated upon the completion of every on-chain transaction and denominated in U.S.
          dollars as follows. This means that:
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          (a) At or around the time that the trading fees are paid by the Referral, we will calculate the prevailing USD
          price of the trading fees (and your commissions which is a percentage of that) using the prevailing USD price
          of the tokens that the trading fees are denominated in (“<strong>Trading Fees Denomination</strong>”) at that
          time; and
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          (b) At or around the time that the commissions are paid out to you, using the USD value calculated at Clause
          4.3(a) , we will calculate your commissions in CAKE tokens using the prevailing USD price of CAKE tokens at
          that time.
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">4.4 In calculating your commissions, we reserve the right to determine the:</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          (a) prevailing USD price of the Trading Fees Denomination and the CAKE tokens by reference to the spot price
          on a centralised exchange, the exchange rate in a liquidity pool, or a data oracle in our sole discretion; and
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">(b) exact timing which the prevailing price is taken at.</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.5 Our system will generate a report of the commissions that you have earnt on a dashboard which we will
          provide you access with. In the absence of manifest error, the report shall serve as conclusive evidence of
          the commissions that you have earnt (subject to this Agreement).
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.6 You may request to redeem your commissions once a month, subject to changes made in our sole discretion,
          with notice to you. (e.g., We may decide to allow you to redeem commissions earlier than once a month, or in
          cases of technical difficulties, we may delay your redemption request and release commissions beyond a one
          month period.)
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.7 Redemptions are done on a monthly basis, subject to changes made in our sole discretion, with notice to
          you – i.e., you may only request to redeem commissions earnt in the previous calendar month (or for an earlier
          time period).
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.8 You shall be responsible for paying all taxes, charges, levies, assessments and other fees of any kind
          imposed on your involvement in this Agreement.
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.9 If we are required by applicable laws to withhold taxes on any payments due to you, or to account for any
          sales tax / VAT / GST on payments due to you, we reserve the right to do so.
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          4.10 For the avoidance of doubt, commissions are accrued only when the following conditions are met:
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">(a) The Referral signs up using your unique referral link;</Text>
        <Text as="p">(b) The Referral pays the trading fees; and</Text>

          further commissions (i.e., commissions will cease to accrue), from the date of termination of this Agreement.
        </Text>

        <Text as="h3">5. Forfeiture of Commissions and suspension</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          If in our reasonable view, you breach any term of this Agreement (especially Clause 16 (Prohibited
          Activities)), with respect to commissions that accrued after the time of the breach, we reserve the right to
          (without prejudice to any other remedies that may be available to us in law):
        </Text>

          (b) decline your registration for the Program, suspend your related accounts, and any other administrative
          measures to cease your involvement with the Program.

        <Text as="h3">6. Unilateral variation and changes</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          6.1 Provided that we do not prejudice any commissions already accrued by you, we reserve the right to
          unilaterally vary upon notice to you at any time, the following:
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">(a) commission rates, terms and eligibility of the commissions; and/or</Text>

        <Text as="p">
          6.2 Without limiting the scope of our discretion in Clause 6.1 , we may elect to revise the commission rates,
          terms and eligibility of the commissions on a monthly basis considering circumstances including but not
          limited to:
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">(a) Change in business environment;</Text>
        <Text as="p">(b) unexpected trading volumes or activity by the Referrals; and/or</Text>
        <Text as="p">(c) unsuitable trading profile of the Referrals.</Text>
        <Text as="p">
          6.3 An electronic message by us to any of the means of communication (i.e., email address, telegram) provided
          by you shall constitute valid notice.
        </Text>
        <Text as="p">
          6.4 We reserve the right to make changes to, vary, or even discontinue, the services to the Referrals (and/or
          to you) at our discretion, at any time (e.g., the swap or perpetual services). For the avoidance of doubt, the
          trading fees charged on the services, or any platforms or providers used in the course of providing the
          services may be changed or varied.
